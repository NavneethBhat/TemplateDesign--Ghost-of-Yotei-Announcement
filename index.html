            Without flukes, feeding is difficult: Gray whales need their tails as a propeller to navigate headfirst into the muddy seafloor and filter out small crustaceans. What's more, the species' lengthy migration from birthing grounds in Mexico to feeding grounds in the Arctic becomes extremely challenging without a tail to power their journey. 
            See "A Gray Whale Breaks the Record for the Longest Mammal Migration. Flukeless mothers also can't defend their calves from killer whales.
            That said, Schulman-Janiger, a whale biologist who runs the American Cetacean Society's Gray Whale Census and Behavior Project, is fascinated by some animals' ability to adapt to their handicap.
